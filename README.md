ALT: A site with a golden navbar with the title of Bookshelf, followed by the respective links: Library, Add and Find, right above, a bookslist

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I really wanted to make a platform to store my books, and all the platforms that i discover online, don't have the tools that a reader needs, so the Bookshelf is a platform that you can use to not only store your reading books, but also search for books using your taste.

Optimizations
Later..

Lessons Learned:
At this point, i'm studying the methods to search for books
